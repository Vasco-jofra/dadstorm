# dadstorm
A simplified (and therefore far from complete) implementation of a fault-tolerant real-time distributed stream processing system.


# USAGE:
 - 1 Visual studio setup:
      - 1.1 Set as startup projects ProcessCreationService and PuppetMaster
      - 1.2 Click start

 - 2 Select the PuppetMaster window
      - 2.1 Specify the config file: 
           - 2.1.1 Click <enter> to run the default config file
           - OR 
           - 2.1.2 Specify which config you would like to use
      - 2.2 Specify whether to step or autorun:
           - 2.2.1 'y' for step
           - OR
           - 2.2.2 'n' (or <enter>) for autorun

 - 3 Enjoy. In the console, you can write commands. Type 'help' for help.
